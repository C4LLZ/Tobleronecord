<summary>TOS Notice</summary>
   
Client modifications ARE against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don’t use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use! (i hope, oops, dont quote me on that.)

Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods, just to be safe

ALSO, People still have the right to ban you from their server for whatever reason they like, showcasing your client mods may lead to yourself being banned from that server.

### Toblerone Plugins

Most stock toblerone plugins are created by yours truly, otherwise they are attributed in the authors field of the plugin.

### Other Authors

Tobleronecord includes quite a few plugins not originally from me. Usually the devs are credited as the author of the plugin, but in the case where it's just a null reference, you can most likely find more information about them on the [Suncord](https://github.com/verticalsync/Suncord) or [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord) repos (where a lot of the plugins are from)
