<summary>TOS Notice</summary>
   
Client modifications ARE against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don’t use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use! (i hope, oops, dont quote me on that.)

Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods, just to be safe

ALSO, People still have the right to ban you from their server for whatever reason they like, showcasing your client mods may lead to yourself being banned from that server.

Here you can find credits for all of the code I used in tobleronecord

### Toblerone Plugins

A LOT are by me, otherwise the developer is credited in the authors field of the plugin.

### Suncord/Equicord Plugins

Tobleronecord includes a few plugins (and utils they require) originally from [Suncord](https://github.com/verticalsync/Suncord) or [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord). All authors *should* have been credited in the authors field of their plugins, but there might be a few null references to the devs construct.
If you are one of the original authors and have concerns about the inclusion, removal, or attribution of your code, feel free to contact me on discord :3.
